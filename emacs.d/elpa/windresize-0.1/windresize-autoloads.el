Resize windows interactively.
INCREMENT is the number of lines by which borders should move.

By default, the method for resizing is by moving the borders.
The left/right key will move the only movable vertical border to
the left/right and the up/down key will move the only horizontal
movable border up/down.  If there are two movable borders, the
right and the bottom border will have priority over the left and
upper border.  You can reverse this priority by using \\[windresize-left-force-left],
\\[windresize-right-force-left], etc.

Resizing can also be done by increasing/decreasing the window
width and height.  The up and down arrow keys will enlarge or
shrink the window vertically and the right and left arrow keys
will enlarge or shrink the window horizontally.

You can toggle the method with \\[windresize-toggle-method].

You can set the number of line by which a border should move by
calling \\[windresize-set-increment] with a numeric prefix.
You can temporarily negate the number of lines by which the
windows are resized by using \\[windresize-left-minus], \\[windresize-right-minus], etc.
If you want to permanently negate this increment value,
use `\\[windresize-negate-increment]' instead.

You can also save window configurations with `\\[windresize-save-window-configuration]' in a ring,
and restore them with `\\[windresize-restore-window-configuration]'.

`\\[windresize-cancel-and-quit]' will quit `windresize' and cancel any change.  `\\[windresize-exit]'
will set the new window configuration and exit.
